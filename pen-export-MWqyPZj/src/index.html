  <center><p><h1>The History of Huey P. Newton</h1></p></center>
  <center><p><h3>By Pedro Luevanos</h3></p></center>
  
  <center><p>Huey Percy Newton was born on February 17, 1942, in Monroe, Louisiana. The youngest of seven siblings, he and his family moved to Oakland, California when Newton was a toddler. The youngster had a difficult time early in life, which was reflected in highly turbulant behavior at school and on the streets. Despite having multiple suspensions and run-ins with the law as a teen, Newton began to take his education seriously, finding inspiration when his older brother Melvin earned a masters in social work. Although Newton graduated high school in 1959, he was considered barely literate. He became his own teacher anyways, learning to read by himself.</p></center>
  
  <center><p>In 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the left-wing Black Panther Party for Self Defense in Oakland, California. The organization was central to the Black Power movement, making headlines with its controversial rhetoric and militaristic style. Newton faced a number of criminal charges over the years and at one point fled to Cuba before returning to the U.S. and earning his doctorate. Struggling with drug and alcohol addiction in his later years, he was killed in 1989 in Oakland by a man named Tyrone Robinson, from getting fatally shot twice in the head.</p></center>
